#Django to iOS || Getting Started Guide

## System requirements
- [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/osx/)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) version 6+
- Carthage Installed. [Installation Guide](https://github.com/codingforentrepreneurs/Guides/blob/master/install_carthage.md)
	- Carthage Errors? Try using Cocoapods. [Installation Guide](https://github.com/codingforentrepreneurs/Guides/blob/master/install_cocoapods.md)



### iOS
1. Create a new iOS Project:
	1. Open `Xcode` > `File` > `New Project`
	2. Select iOS Project template `Single View Application`, click `Next`
	3. Fill in the following:
		```
		Product Name: project
		Organization Name: Naveen Singh
		Organization Identifier: net.naveensingh
		```

	4. Select `Swift` as the Language
	5. Deselect `Core Data` (unless you know how to use it of course)
	6. Create in a location of your choice. For example:
		`Desktop`
	7. This will create a new folder on your desktop based on the name of your project. In this example, it will read as `project`



2. Install `Alamofire`, `KeychainAccess`, and `SwiftyJSON`: 
	
	Using Carthage, we're going to install these frameworks for our project. This is not the only way to install these frameworks but Carthage makes our life easy. Let's get started:
		
	1. Create a new file called `Cartfile` with no extension in your project's directory. This is the same place you'll see your `.xcodeproj` file. In our example above, it will be `CFE.xcodeproj`.

	2. In the cartfile, you'll add:

	```
	github "Alamofire/Alamofire" >= 1.2
	github "SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON" >= 2.2
	github "kishikawakatsumi/KeychainAccess" >= 1.2.1
	```
	*Note*: This github repositories have been tested by Carthage as working packages. If you use Carthage, there's a chance that other non-tested packages will fail to install properly.

	3. Open the Terminal Application (Applications > Utilities > Terminal)
	4. Navigate to our XCode Project folder (where `project.xcodeproj` is located): 
	      

	5. Run Carthage Update

		```
		carthage update
		```

	6. Link Frameworks:
		1. "Srvup" > "General" -> "Linked Frameworks and Libraries"
		2. Add "Alamofire", "KeychainAccess", and "SwiftyJSON"

	7. Add Compiling Scripts:
		1. "project" > "Build Phases" -> "+"
		2. Enter the following:
			Shell: `/bin/sh`
			1: `/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks`
		3. Input Files:
			`$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/Alamofire.framework`
			`$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/KeychainAccess.framework`
			`$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/SwiftyJSON.framework`

### Testing Installations:

#####Testing Almofire:

```
		1. "project" > "Build Phases" -> "+"
		2. Enter the following:
			Shell: `/bin/sh`
			1: `/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks`
		3. Input Files:
			`$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/Alamofire.framework`
			`$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/KeychainAccess.framework`
			`$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/SwiftyJSON.framework`
```
